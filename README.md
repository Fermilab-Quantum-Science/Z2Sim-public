# Z2Sim

This repository is for the Google Cloud Burst and Fermilab collaboration on large lattice simulations of 2 + 1-D **Z** <sub>2</sub>
gauge theory using both dual and gauge representations of the theory.

## Installation

The package `z2_sim` can be installed as a local package in order to run the scripts and benchmarks. `qsimcirq` can be installed via pip locally, but any GPU submission scripts will require `qsimcirq` to be installed from source.
